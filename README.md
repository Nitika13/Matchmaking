# Matchmaking
# 🔥 AI-Based Matchmaking System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered matchmaking system** that intelligently pairs users based on their textual responses. It uses **Word2Vec embeddings** to understand the semantic meaning of responses and **cosine similarity** to determine how closely two users' responses align.  

✅ **Friendship & Social Networking** – Matching users with similar interests. 

## 🚀 Key Features  
✔ **Natural Language Understanding** – Uses Word2Vec embeddings to capture the meaning of user responses.  
✔ **Smart Matching** – Employs cosine similarity to rank user compatibility.  
✔ **Scalable Architecture** – Can be integrated into web apps, chatbots, or mobile applications.  
✔ **Customizable Matching Criteria** – Can be fine-tuned based on specific requirements.
